Certainly! Here are the 30 important Bash operators with their 
functions explained and written 
out in code format:

1. `=` (Equal to):
   - Explanation: Used for string or numeric comparison to check if two 
values are equal.
   - Code: `[ "$var1" = "$var2" ]`

2. `!=` (Not equal to):
   - Explanation: Checks if two values are not equal.
   - Code: `[ "$var1" != "$var2" ]`

3. `-eq` (Equal):
   - Explanation: Used for integer comparison to check if two numbers are 
equal.
   - Code: `[ "$num1" -eq "$num2" ]`

4. `-ne` (Not equal):
   - Explanation: Checks if two integers are not equal.
   - Code: `[ "$num1" -ne "$num2" ]`

5. `-lt` (Less than):
   - Explanation: Checks if one integer is less than another.
   - Code: `[ "$num1" -lt "$num2" ]`

6. `-le` (Less than or equal to):
   - Explanation: Checks if one integer is less than or equal to another.
   - Code: `[ "$num1" -le "$num2" ]`

7. `-gt` (Greater than):
   - Explanation: Checks if one integer is greater than another.
   - Code: `[ "$num1" -gt "$num2" ]`

8. `-ge` (Greater than or equal to):
   - Explanation: Checks if one integer is greater than or equal to 
another.
   - Code: `[ "$num1" -ge "$num2" ]`

9. `-z` (Zero length):
   - Explanation: Used to check if a string is empty (zero-length).
   - Code: `[ -z "$str" ]`

10. `-n` (Non-zero length):
    - Explanation: Checks if a string has a non-zero length (i.e., it's 
not empty).
    - Code: `[ -n "$str" ]`

11. `&&` (Logical AND):
    - Explanation: Used to execute a command only if the previous command 
succeeds.
    - Code: `command1 && command2`

12. `||` (Logical OR):
    - Explanation: Executes a command only if the previous command fails.
    - Code: `command1 || command2`

13. `>` (Output redirection):
    - Explanation: Redirects the standard output of a command to a file, 
overwriting its contents.
    - Code: `command > file.txt`

14. `>>` (Append output):
    - Explanation: Redirects the standard output of a command to a file, 
appending it to the file's existing contents.
    - Code: `command >> file.txt`

15. `|` (Pipe):
    - Explanation: Connects the standard output of one command to the 
standard input of another.
    - Code: `command1 | command2`

16. `*` (Wildcard):
    - Explanation: Represents zero or more characters in file or directory 
names.
    - Code: `*.txt` matches all `.txt` files.

17. `?` (Single character wildcard):
    - Explanation: Represents a single character in file or directory 
names.
    - Code: `file?.txt` matches `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, etc.

18. `[]` (Character class):
    - Explanation: Defines a range of characters that can match a single 
character in a string.
    - Code: `[aeiou]` matches any vowel.

19. `{}` (Brace expansion):
    - Explanation: Generates a sequence of strings or commands based on a 
pattern.
    - Code: `echo {1..5}` prints `1 2 3 4 5`.

20. `$` (Variable):
    - Explanation: Used to access the value of a variable.
    - Code: `echo $var`

21. `(( ))` (Arithmetic evaluation):
    - Explanation: Evaluates mathematical expressions.
    - Code: `(( sum = num1 + num2 ))`

22. `!` (Logical NOT):
    - Explanation: Reverses the logical value of a condition.
    - Code: `if ! condition`

23. `[[ ]]` (Extended test command):
    - Explanation: Performs more advanced conditional tests in Bash.
    - Code: `[[ -e file ]]` checks if a file exists.

24. `(( ))` (Arithmetic evaluation):
    - Explanation: Used to perform arithmetic operations.
    - Code: `(( total = num1 * num2 ))`

25. `$( )` (Command substitution):
    - Explanation: Replaces the command inside with its output.
    - Code: `result=$(command)`

26. `(( ))` (Double parentheses):
    - Explanation: Used for arithmetic operations and comparisons.
    - Code: `if (( num1 < num2 ))`

27. `<<` (Here document):
    - Explanation: Allows you to define a block of text or code inline.
    - Code: `cat <<EOF ... EOF`

28. `>` (Input redirection):
    - Explanation: Redirects the standard input of a command from a file.
    - Code: `command < input.txt`

29. `&` (Background process):
    - Explanation: Runs a command in the background.
    - Code: `command &`

30. `!` (History substitution):
    - Explanation: Repeats or modifies a previously executed command from 
the shell history.
    - Code: `!ls`

These operators are essential for various Bash scripting tasks, including 
conditional statements, file manipulation, and command execution.
